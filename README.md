# CART-banknote

Classification and Regression Trees or CART for short is an acronym introduced by Leo Breiman to refer to 
Decision Tree algorithms that can be used for classification or regression predictive modelling problems.

The representation of the CART model is a binary tree. This is the same binary tree from algorithms and data structures,
nothing too fancy (each node can have zero, one or two child nodes).

<b>Banknote Dataset</b>
The banknote dataset involves predicting whether a given banknote is authentic given a number of measures taken from a photograph.
The dataset contains 1,372 rows with 5 numeric variables.</br>
It is a classification problem with two classes (binary classification).</br>

Below provides a list of the five variables in the dataset.</br>
variance of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous).</br>
skewness of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous).</br>
kurtosis of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous).</br>
entropy of image (continuous).</br>
class (integer).
